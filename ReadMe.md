# Dataset Statistics

In `computer vision`, we have a lot of datasets that are used for different tasks. These datasets are used to train and test models. The datasets are usually in the form of images, videos, or both. The datasets are usually annotated with labels that are used to train the models. The labels are usually in the form of bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or both.

For the 3 main tasks in computer vision (`Detection`, `Segmentation`, and `Tracking`), we are going to look at the datasets that are used for each task. We are going to look at the statistics of each dataset and perform a comparison in the end.

To do this we will need to load each dataset and extract it's statistics programatically. We will also need to visualize the statistics in a way that is easy to understand. We will also need to compare the statistics of each dataset and see how they compare to each other.


The task flow will be as follows:

For each task;
* research task specific datasets. 
For each dataset;
    - [ ] 1. Download the dataset
    - [ ] 2. Write dataset loaders
    - [ ] 3. Extract the statistics
    - [ ] 4. Save the statistics
    - [ ] 5. Visualize the statistics
    - [ ] 6. Compare the statistics
    - [ ] 7. Write a report
